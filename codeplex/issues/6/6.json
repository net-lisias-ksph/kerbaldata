To accommodate this requirement at this stage all relevant classes and methods include overloads to accept:\n\n* A config section name to look up in the App.Config\n* A config model instance with the correct information (loaded from any source)\n* Key Repo, Converter and Serializer instances required by the API\n\nThis should, for the time being satisfy most if not all desired custom setup/init scenarios. \n\nThis story will be closed out when the implementations are complete however this is being done in parallel with configurable components.
