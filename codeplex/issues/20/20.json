    "Description": "The latest release includes some reflection code that is using a 4.5 only method. \r\n\r\nTo address:\r\n* Implement conditional compilation\r\n* Develop alternate code-lines for affected areas\r\n* Produce updated 0.2.0 release for as many .NET versions as possible.\r\n\r\nTarget Frameworks: .NET 4, .NET 3.5 and Mono 2.10.x\r\nNice to Have: .NET 3.0 and .NET 2.0\r\n\r\nNote: this is an out-of-band fix and may delay later releases but by putting this in place today I will be in a better place to ensure more universal support in future releases.
