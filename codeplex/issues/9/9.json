    "Description": "Mods for mapping, GPS, comms and other features (as well as upcoming game features) require a number of craft in orbit in order to provide the feature. \r\n\r\nExtend orbit features to load a list of craft (or copies of a single craft) and place each craft in the same or differing orbits based on parameters. \r\n\r\nProvide common orbit group templates like:\r\n\r\n* traditional US GPS system\r\n* geo-sync\r\n* polar orbit mapping\r\n* comms relay network\r\n* suggestions for constellation types and popular orbits are welcome!",
