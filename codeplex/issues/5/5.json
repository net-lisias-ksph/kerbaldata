    "Description": "Converters and mappers exist at lower level APIs to handle for the changes in the raw conversion process of KSP data to a usable string. However if the layout of the data changes, higher level classes (and real consumers) using the data may break. \r\n\r\nAnalysis and design should be conducted to determine the best strategy to handle for this as gracefully as possible. \r\n\r\nThis will likely dovetail with more aggressive wrapping of JSON.Net's object types.
