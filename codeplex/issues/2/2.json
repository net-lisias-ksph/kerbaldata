    "Description": "Make data converters swappable via config and DI to allow for custom stack based processing. This will enable the ability to create upgrade paths as well as publish/read/convert KSP data into any desired format. IE CSV for excel, PDF for a nice report, graphs, nav plotting, 3D systems, etc. \r\n\r\nChanges at this layer should have little to no impact on the consumer API. ",
