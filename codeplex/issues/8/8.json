    "Description": "When putting a craft in a custom orbit the common procedure calls for the end user to:\r\n\r\n* start the game\r\n* load a craft and put it on the pad\r\n* close the game\r\n* edit the orbit\r\n\r\nWith the current tools we have eliminated the need for a user to manually edit the file. \r\n\r\nAdd capabilities to import a .craft file directly into a game save by performing the same processing steps handled by KSP when putting a craft on the pad (mainly adding orbit nodes and setting up relationships using the additional craft file meta-data) \r\n\r\nSupport Import/Export of Craft and Vessels\r\n* Input > Output\r\n* Craft > Vessel\r\n* Vessel > Craft",

      "Message": "After taking a close look at a craft file and it's version loaded in save data I have determined the basic strategy used by the game to construct a VESSEL object. However it is going to take some time to test each part type to discover all the types of auto-generated modules that are added when the vessel is created. \n\nFurther I need to better understand the association between certain key values like attN and how to calculate them in  a VESSEL. \n\nAs to not delay the upcoming release which already has a lot of changes this task will be pushed to an upcoming release.
