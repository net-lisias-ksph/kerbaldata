    "Description": "Create additional documentation for the help site to include quickstart walkthroughs for the following:\r\n\r\n* WPF Application\r\n* Class Library\r\n* Console Application\r\n* Web Application\r\n\r\nInitial code will be produced using .NET 4 as the target with expanded support for Mono 2.10.x\r\n\r\nNote: no examples will leverage the .NET 3.5 framework. While the API has a build for 3.5 and it is tested to work many modern UI development concepts start with .NET 4. These applications are much easier to develop in .NET 4 and as these are supposed to be quick examples I am dismissing .NET 3.5 use for them. ",
