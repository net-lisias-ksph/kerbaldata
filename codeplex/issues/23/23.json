    "Description": "For the time being all classes have been marked as unsafe for multi-threaded use. This is only because testing has yet to be conducted. For the most part the API supports multi-threading as I take advantage of design practices as mush as possible.\r\n\r\nThis task is to certify multi-threadded use, change code where needed and update documentation ",
